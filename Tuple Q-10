You are a software developer working on a program that manages student records for a school. 
Each student's record is represented as a tuple, where each element contains specific information such as the student's name, age, and grade. 
Occasionally, you need to remove a student record from the database due to various reasons such as graduation or withdrawal from the school. 
Your task is to write a Python program to remove a student record from the database.

Input Format:
First Line consists of Students Details(Name,Age,Grade )separated by comma.Every student details is separated by semicolon
Second Line of Input consists of the index to be removed in the tuple.

Note: If You enter the index number,which is greater than the length of tuple,it must display Invalid index 

Output Format:
output shows the resultant tuple.

Sample Input:
Gokul,18,O+;Gowtham,19,O-;Haniel,20,A+
1

Sample Output:

(('Gokul', 18, 'O+'), ('Haniel', 20, 'A+'))
First index is removed,it shows the resultant tuple

Solution:

overall_lst=tuple(map(str,input().split(";")))
new_lst=[] 
for i in overall_lst:
    lst=[]
    name,age,grade=i.split(",")
    lst.append(name)
    lst.append(int(age))
    lst.append(grade)
    new_lst.append(tuple(lst))
ind=int(input())
if(ind<len(new_lst)):
    new_lst.pop(ind)
    print(tuple(new_lst))
else:
    print("Invalid index")
