Your book club is discussing a novel with a large cast of characters. 
To keep track of the characters and their roles in the story, you'd like to write a Python program to iterate over a set containing the character names.

Input Format:
Multiple lines where each line contains a single character's name. The input ends with an empty line.

Output Format:
A single line containing all character names in the set, separated by commas and sorted alphabetically.

Sample Input:
Alice
Bob
Charlie
Alice
Bob

Sample Output:
Alice, Bob, Charlie

Solution:

se=set()
while(1):
    val=input()
    if(val==""):
        break
    else:
        se.add(val)
se1=sorted(se)
se2=",".join(se1)
print(se2)
