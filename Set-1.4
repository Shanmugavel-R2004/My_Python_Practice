You're a student and want to manage your course schedule for the upcoming semester. 
You initially create a set containing the courses you're enrolled in. 
However, due to scheduling conflicts or changes in interest, you might need to remove some courses.

Input Format:
The input will start with an integer n, the number of initial courses.
The next n lines will each contain the name of a course (a string).
The next line will contain an integer m, the number of courses to be removed.
The following m lines will each contain the name of a course to be removed (a string).

Output Format:
The output will be the list of remaining courses, each on a new line, in lexicographical order.

Sample Input:
5
Mathematics
Physics
Chemistry
Biology
History
2
Biology
History

Sample Output:
Chemistry
Mathematics
Physics

Solution:

n=int(input())
ls=[]
ls2=[]
for i in range(0,n):
    sub=input()
    ls.append(sub)
    se=set(ls)
r=int(input())
for i in range(0,r):
    rs=input()
    ls2.append(rs)
se2=set(ls2)
se3=se.difference(se2)
se4=sorted(se3)
for i in se4:
    print(i)
