Imagine you're managing a movie recommendation system. You have two lists:
1)user_watchlist: A list containing the titles of movies a user has added to their watchlist.
2)available_movies: A list containing all the movies currently available in the system.
You want to write a function to check if there are any movies (at least one) on the user's watchlist that are also available to watch. Lists in Python are ideal for storing movie titles, and set comparisons can efficiently determine if there's any overlap between the lists.

Input Format:
The first line contains an integer 'n' representing the number of movies in the user's watchlist.
The second line contains 'n' space-separated strings representing the titles of the movies in the user's watchlist.
The third line contains an integer 'm' representing the number of movies available in the system.
The fourth line contains 'm' space-separated strings representing the titles of the movies available in the system.

Output Format:
If there is at least one movie that is both in the user's watchlist and available in the system, print 'Yes'.
Otherwise, print 'No'.

Sample Input:
4
Inception Matrix Avatar Interstellar
5
Avatar Titanic Matrix Gravity Dunkirk

Sample Output:
Yes

Solution:

w=int(input())
wish=input().split()
wa=int(input())
watch=input().split()
count=0
for movie1 in wish:
    if(movie1 in watch):
        count+=1
if(count>=1):
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
